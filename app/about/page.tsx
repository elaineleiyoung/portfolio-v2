					<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">What I like</h2>
						<p className="text-white">
						I grew up exploring lots of different things, so I have a pretty wide variety of interests. 
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						I like playing golf and rock climbing. I've been golfing since 2016 and used to be on my high school's golf team.
						I recently started rock climbing, but I enjoy the accomplishment of solving and sending new routes.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Speaking of problem solving, I am deeply passionate about solving puzzles and critical thinking. I think one of the best applications of these skills is through gaming!
						As such, I like to play many games, from chess and Dungeons and Dragons to League of Legends and Fortnite.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						I focus on music as a creative outlet. I grew up playing the cello and piano, and music has always been a big part of my life.
						Currently, I'm learning how to play classical guitar, but I love music of all genres. 
						<br></br>
