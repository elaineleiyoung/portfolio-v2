***A Swift Path to Graduation***

As I near the conclusion of my three-year academic journey at Boston University majoring in Computer Science, I find myself reflecting on what has been an incredibly dynamic and intense experience. Diving into the depths of computer science, I managed to complete my major requirements ahead of time, with just one more class left at the time I am writing this. The purpose of sharing this post is to offer insight and guidance to fellow and future CS majors at BU, detailing the challenges and learning curves I encountered along the way. I discuss the department's shortcomings, not to complain about my hardships, but rather in hopes that my voice can be heard as part of a call for change. I'm detailing my experiences here so that others will be able to recognize areas for improvement. For context, here's a rundown of the courses I've taken: CS112, CS131, CS210, CS132, CS330, CS237, CS350, CS411, CS412, CS440, CS492 (directed study), XC475 (Spark!), and EC403 (which counts as a CS elective).

***A Mixed Bag of Course Experiences***

My academic path took me through a diverse array of classes, from Intro to Computer Science II (CS112) to the more advanced Intro to AI (CS440). However, the learning experience varied greatly across courses. Notably, many resources in BUâ€™s CS classes were borrowed from institutions like MIT and Princeton. While this does reflect a commitment to quality, it simultaneously raises questions about the department's originality in course materials. There is nothing wrong with borrowing materials from other courses, but one outstanding issue was that students at BU often got a watered-down version of the original content due to the instructors' lack of familiarity with the borrowed information.

On the other hand, courses that relied on homebrew materials often suffered from disorganization and incompleteness, clouding the learning experience with frustration and technical difficulties. 

***Standout Classes and Instructors***

Despite these challenges, certain classes stood out for their exceptional educational value. CS440 (Intro to AI) under Andrew Wood and CS132 (Geometric Algorithms) with Mark Crovella were notable highlights: these courses, powered by original notes and resources, provided engaging and insightful learning experiences. Andrew Wood is one of the best instructors I've had while at Boston University due to his genuine passion for the subject and care for his students. His lectures are engaging, and he makes sure to have plenty of resources for his students: from recorded lectures to several office hours sections a week, Andrew Wood does his best to make the class informative and enjoyable. 

Moreover, CS411 (Software Engineering) and CS412 (Full-Stack Development) with Perry Donham were particularly enjoyable. They focused on real-world applications and industry-relevant technologies, delving into Agile methodologies, MEAN stack, Oauth, and databases. Professor Donham is a very understanding and laid-back personality, and he is one of the few professors at BU who cares more about the practical information you retain rather than memorizing edge cases you'll never use again. He always encourages us to use the tools at our disposal and to simulate a real, working  environment in our assignments. 

***Experiential Learning in XC475***

On the other side of the spectrum is HUB XC475, better known as Spark! Technology Innovation Fellowship Course, which is a class offered under the cross-college curriculum. The class has a practical, hands-on approach to product development, though not without its pitfalls. My experience was marred by overemphasis on formalities and an overly critical grading system on seemingly trivial and frivolous assignments. Moreover, the excessive focus on team-building and planning activities often felt like a drag on the actual development process.

A notable challenge was the lack of organization, with scattered materials across numerous external files and folders. Furthermore, the team dynamics heavily influenced one's experience in the class. My project manager, for instance, lacked technical expertise and had a wavering vision for our project. The lack of direction and communication heavily detracted from my experience in the class, and at times, even inhibited the team's technical development sprints. 

However, I will acknowledge that the experience of working with a team and struggling through developing a project are extremely valuable, as the course helped give me insight into real industry practices. From weekly sprints to stand-ups, I learned important teamwork practices and good coding habits that have carried into my internship and program work. 

***The Department's Technical Shortcomings***

Despite the aforementioned courses, the department's curriculum heavily leans towards theoretical knowledge, with scant connections to industry practices. Many of the classes focus on niche and isolated content that the undergraduate education at BU does not supplement well enough to be of use in the real world. A high GPA at BU does not necessarily correlate to competency in a real working environment. Additionally, the struggle to enroll in desired classes due to limited seats and faculty only adds to one's frustration. The ease of picking up or dropping the CS major/minor also diminishes the perceived value of the major, contributing to resource constraints for those genuinely committed. Given how many people add on a CS major/minor, the department is substantially understaffed and lacks the necessary resources to handle such a large number of people.

***Comparisons and Resource Allocation***

Additionally, the CS department's affiliation with the new College of Data Science (CDS) has not necessarily translated into benefits for CS students. Few classes are actually held in the new CDS building, and the department often seems overshadowed by faculties like the Questrom School of Business and CDS itself. This disparity has led many students to pivot to the seemingly more valuable and less demanding Data Science major.

The department's approach of using difficult content and a grading curve to maintain a median performance level is a disservice to students' potential. Instead of fostering enthusiasm for computer science, this strategy seems more focused on maintaining a facade of high educational standards. In some courses, many students who put in countless hours end up with the same grade as those who barely spent any time on the assignments. The grading system favors those who just want to get by while penalizing those who put in time but fail to fall within the top n %. As a result, many students feel putting time and effort into these classes are just not worth their results. 

***Concluding Remarks***

In summary, my time in Boston University's Computer Science (CS) department has been a journey of mixed experiences, marked by both challenges and achievements. While I commend the department for its rigorous academic approach, it's evident that there's room for improvement, particularly in striking a more effective balance between theoretical concepts and their practical applications in the real world. The department could greatly benefit from a more systematic allocation of resources and a more cohesive academic structure. This would not only enhance the learning experience but also better prepare students for the demands of the tech industry.

These experiences have profoundly shaped my professional perspective, underscoring the importance of adaptability, resilience, and the continuous pursuit of knowledge in the dynamic and fast-paced world of computer science. My experiences have highlighted the necessity for academic programs to evolve alongside technological advancements, ensuring that students are not only challenged intellectually but also supported with the appropriate resources and practical skills that are crucial in today's tech landscape.

Looking ahead, as I stand on the threshold of completing my degree, I envision a future where the CS department at Boston University not only pushes its students to reach new heights of academic excellence but also provides a robust support system. This includes access to state-of-the-art resources, opportunities for hands-on experience, and a curriculum that mirrors the rapid advancements in technology. My hope is for a department that not only challenges its students but also equips them with the necessary tools, knowledge, and skills to excel and innovate in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
