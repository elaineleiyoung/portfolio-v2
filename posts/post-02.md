***A Swift Path to Graduation***

As I approach the end of my three-year journey at Boston University, majoring in Computer Science, the experience has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. Diving into the depths of computer science, I managed to complete my major requirements ahead of time, with just one more class left at the time I am writing this. For reference, here's a list of classes I've taken so far: CS112, CS131, CS210, CS132, CS330, CS237, CS350, CS411, CS412, XC475, CS492, CS440, and EC403 (counts as a CS elective). 

***A Mixed Bag of Course Experiences***

My academic path took me through a diverse array of classes, from Intro to Computer Science II (CS112) to the more advanced Intro to AI (CS440). However, the learning experience varied greatly across courses. Notably, many resources in BUâ€™s CS classes were borrowed from institutions like MIT and Princeton. While this does reflect a commitment to quality, it simultaneously raises questions about the department's originality in course materials. While there is nothing wrong with borrowing materials from other courses, one outstanding issue was that students at BU often got a more watered-down version of the original materials, due to the instructors' lack of familiarity with the borrowed content.

On the other hand, courses that relied on homebrew materials often suffered from disorganization and incompleteness, clouding the learning experience with frustration and technical difficulties. 

***Standout Classes and Instructors***

Despite these challenges, certain classes stood out for their exceptional educational value. CS440 (Intro to AI) under Andrew Wood and CS132 (Geometric Algorithms) with Mark Crovella were notable highlights: these courses, powered by original notes and resources, provided engaging and insightful learning experiences. Andrew Wood is one of the best instructors I've had while at Boston University due to his genuine passion for the subject and care for his students. His lectures are engaging, and he makes sure to have plenty of resources for his students: from recorded lectures to several office hours sections a week, Andrew Wood does his best to make the class informative and enjoyable. 

Moreover, CS411 (Software Engineering) and CS412 (Full-Stack Development) with Perry Donham were particularly enjoyable. They focused on real-world applications and industry-relevant technologies, delving into Agile methodologies, MEAN stack, Oauth, and databases. Professor Donham is a very understanding and laid-back personality, and he is one of the few professors at BU who cares more about the practical information you retain rather than memorizing edge cases you'll never use again. He always encourages us to use the tools at our disposal and to simulate a real, working  environment in our assignments. 

***Experiential Learning in XC475***

On the other side of the spectrum is HUB XC475, better known as Spark! Technology Innovation Fellowship Course, which is a class offered under the cross-college curriculum. The class has a practical, hands-on approach to product development, though not without its pitfalls. My experience was marred by overemphasis on formalities and an overly critical grading system on seemingly trivial and frivolous assignments. Moreover, the excessive focus on team-building and planning activities often felt like a drag on the actual development process.

A notable challenge was the lack of organization, with scattered materials across numerous external files and folders. Furthermore, the team dynamics heavily influenced one's experience in the class. My project manager, for instance, lacked technical expertise and had a wavering vision for our project. The lack of direction and communication heavily detracted from my experience in the class, and at times, even inhibited the team's technical development sprints. 

However, I will acknowledge that the experience of working with a team and struggling through developing a project are extremely valuable, as the course helped give me insight into real industry practices. From weekly sprints to stand-ups, I learned important teamwork practices and good coding habits that have carried into my internship and program work. 

***The Department's Technical Shortcomings***

Despite the aforementioned courses, the department's curriculum heavily leans towards theoretical knowledge, with scant connections to industry practices. Many of the classes focus on niche and isolated content that the undergraduate education at BU does not supplement well enough to be of use in the real world. A high GPA at BU does not necessarily correlate to competency in a real working environment. Additionally, the struggle to enroll in desired classes due to limited seats and faculty only adds to one's frustration. The ease of picking up or dropping the CS major/minor also diminishes the perceived value of the major, contributing to resource constraints for those genuinely committed. Given how many people add on a CS major/minor, the department is substantially understaffed and lacks the necessary resources to handle such a large number of people.

***Comparisons and Resource Allocation***

Additionally, the CS department's affiliation with the new College of Data Science (CDS) has not necessarily translated into benefits for CS students. Few classes are actually held in the new CDS building, and the department often seems overshadowed by faculties like the Questrom School of Business and CDS itself. This disparity has led many students to pivot to the seemingly more valuable and less demanding Data Science major.

The department's approach of using difficult content and a grading curve to maintain a median performance level is a disservice to students' potential. Instead of fostering enthusiasm for computer science, this strategy seems more focused on maintaining a facade of high educational standards. In some courses, many students who put in countless hours end up with the same grade as those who barely spent any time on the assignments. The grading system favors those who just want to get by while penalizing those who put in time but fail to fall within the top n %. As a result, many students feel putting time and effort into these classes are just not worth their results. 

***Concluding Remarks***

In summary, while my journey through BU's CS department has had its share of challenges and triumphs, it's clear that the program could benefit from a more balanced approach between theory and practical application, better resource allocation, and a more structured academic framework. As I move forward, these experiences will undoubtedly shape my professional outlook, reminding me of the importance of adaptability and perseverance in the ever-evolving field of computer science. As I stand at the threshold of completing my degree, I hope for a future where the department not only challenges its students but also provides the necessary support and resources to truly excel in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
